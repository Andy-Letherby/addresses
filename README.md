This repo contains documentation for the Address Lookup microservice, a.k.a. `address-lookup`.
The service provides address searching by UPRN, postcode, BFPO address or fuzzy match.

Please [browse the docs](docs) for more info, or dive straight into 
the [**address-lookup API definition**](docs/address-lookup/address-lookup-api.md).

Other code that was here has been merged into [address-reputation-store](https://github.com/hmrc/address-reputation-store).
